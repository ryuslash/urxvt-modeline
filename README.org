#+STARTUP: showall

A modeline for URxvt.

*Note:* The code in this project has been copied and taken from the
~tabbed~ extension included in the ~rxvt-unicode~ distribution (at least
in Archlinux). I'm still cleaning everything up.

* Usage

  Download and put it in your ~perl-lib~ (or change your ~perl-lib~ to
  contain it), add ~modeline~ to your ~perl-ext-common~, and set the
  ~URxvt.modeline.command~ setting to a shell-executable which produces
  a single line of output which will be shown in the last line of the
  terminal.
